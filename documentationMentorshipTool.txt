I am creating this tool using Firebase to handle the back-end.

The basic setup of the page is a sign up button that will open a modal prompting for email and password.
This will create a user in Firebase.
The user will then get a form to enter relevant information (name, skills, email, etc.) and this will be added
to the firebase database under the userId (generated by firebase)

In the future, a sign in button will allow people to edit their existing information.

The firebase project was created under my account (marie.pelletier@gmail.com). Email me if you need access.
